# daily-health-check.sh — run the OPERATIONAL gates that nothing else was running.
#
# ─── WHY (2026-09-02) ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# An audit found 11 gates that existed and passed but were wired into NO runner. Every one of them
# guards something that fails SILENTLY and off-schedule — a webhook that vanished, a third-party
# subscription that lapsed, a duplicate identity re-opening a door a prospect closed. Those do not
# break a build, so the deploy gates never see them; they just quietly stop working.
#
# "A test nobody runs is not a guard." These now run every morning.
#
#   bash scripts/daily-health-check.sh              # human output
#   bash scripts/daily-health-check.sh --quiet      # only failures (for cron)
#
# Exit 0 = everything healthy · 1 = a real failure · 2 = something could not be determined.
#
# 🔑 Exit 2 (indeterminate) is NOT treated as healthy. A gate that cannot reach Airtable must never
# report green — that is how a dead check reads as a pass.
