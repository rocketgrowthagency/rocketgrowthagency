# overnight-local.sh — CITY-FIRST local-domination overnight runner (locked 2026-07-01).
#
# When Chris says "I'm leaving for the night", THIS is what runs. It:
#   1. Asks next-search.mjs for the nearest unscraped city+business (proximity order, SoCal-first).
#   2. Runs the full video pipeline on it (scrape → render → deploy → publish to Airtable).
#   3. Loops to the NEXT nearest city+business — building a buffer of ready-to-send local videos
#      through the night. The ~50/day send cap drips them out; a backlog of ready videos is good.
# Stops when: the night window (caffeinate) ends, MAX_SEARCHES hit, or SoCal is fully exhausted.
#
# Usage (Chris away only — needs the screen for Maps capture):
#   ./scripts/overnight-local.sh            # loop until window/queue ends
#   MAX_SEARCHES=3 ./scripts/overnight-local.sh
